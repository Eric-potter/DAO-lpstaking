# GREAT NEWS!!!

## Welcome to the beta-test launch of META-POOL, one of the first BIG DAOs on NEAR!

The beta test period on TESTNET is starting, and we need a lot of help from the guilds and the NEAR community.

### What's the meta-staking-pool?

See [here](https://narwallets.github.io/meta-pool/)

### What can I do?

#### Testing

* Test the web app, report bugs here [github.com/Narwallets/webapp-meta-pool/issues](https://github.com/Narwallets/dapp-meta-pool/issues)
* If you find a bug in the contract, report it here [github.com/Narwallets/meta-pool/issues](https://github.com/Narwallets/meta-pool/issues)

#### Ideas & Design

* A great idea for the launch?  A new integration? Tell us on [Narwallet's Discord](https://discord.com/invite/tG4XJzRtdQ)
* More than one UI design, might be popular

#### Economics

* Help define Tokenomics for META

#### Coding

* Squash bugs with PRs, on any of the repos
* Start designing and or coding the Governance-Contract
* Propose and add new features

### Will contributors be rewarded?

Yes, $META (The governance token) will be awarded to collaborators. Your $META will be awarded after Meta-Staking mainnet implementation.

### What will be the value of a META on mainnet?

It's not clear now. It depend son the final tokenomics, on the amount of staking the meta-pool attracts, and the future $META demand.
