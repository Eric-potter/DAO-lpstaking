# GREAT NEWS!!!

## Welcome to the beta-test launch of META-POOL, one of the first BIG DAOs on NEAR!

The beta test period on TESTNET is starting, and we need a lot of help from the guild and the NEAR community.

### What's the meta-staking-pool?

See [here](https://narwallets.github.io/diversifying-staking-pool/)

### What can I do?

#### Testing

* Test the web app, report bugs here [github.com/Narwallets/dapp-diversifying-staking-pool/issues](https://github.com/Narwallets/dapp-diversifying-staking-pool/issues)
* If find a bug in the contract, report it here [github.com/Narwallets/diversifying-staking-pool/issues](https://github.com/Narwallets/diversifying-staking-pool/issues)

#### Designing

* Help by adding beauty to our basic UI 
* More than one UI design, might be popular

#### Analyzing

* Help define Tokenomics for META

#### Coding

* Squash bugs with PRs, on any of the repos
* Start designing and or coding the Governance-Contract
* Propose and add new features

### Will contributors be rewarded?

Yes, META (The governance token) will be awarded to collaborators. Your META will be awarded to your account during div-pool mainnet implementation.

### What will be the value of a META on mainnet?

It's not clear now. It depend on the final tokenomics, it depends on the amount of funding the div-pool attracts, and the future $META demand.
